# MACEst Notebooks

This directory contains notebooks that showcase MACEst for classification and regression.
To use the notebooks as intended, please make sure that you install the Python libraries in your virtual environment
from the `../requirements.txt` and `../requirements_notebooks.txt` files.

We recommend doing the following steps:
1. Create a virtual Python environment and install all dependencies from `../requirements.txt` and
`../requirements_notebooks.txt`.
2. Add the virtual environment's kernel to iPython's kernel list - see [these instructions][ipython_add_kernel] for how
to do this.
3. Start Jupyter notebook server/Jupyter lab and use the added kernel that will include the installed dependencies.

Notebooks are divided into two folders covering the two common Machine Learning problems:
1. Classification (including comparison of MACEst with state of the art calibration methods)
2. Regression
